These are the code related files for my full year 3th year project.

We were tasked with building an autonomous, scale, forklift. To complete this, I decided to use two microcontrollers, one a high level controller with external control, pathfinding, obstacle detection, etc. The other controller was a low level controller tasked with directly driving the motors, steppers, and other direct movement elements.

The final running versions are in the 'Final' subdirectory.
The development versions, as well as supporting test scripts are in the 'Development Files' subdirectory.

There was a lot more work done for this project, however, this is the code part of it (as this is what I primarily worked on.)
